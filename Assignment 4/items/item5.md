**Context:**
Project to critically design something that solves a social issue. 
  
**My Angle:**
My angle on this is that we can't live happy until everyone is safe. And in Canada's cold climate, we forget to think about homeless people and how they are living during the winter. SO to that I chose to solve the social issue of homelessness and the dangers of their environment. I did some research and noted that in Toronto there are about 7,000 beds for homeless people at shelters but roughly 12,000 homeless people. I then decided to design an umbrella with an easily accessible crank to open handle, which also turns into a tent type shelter that protects the user. I decided to use a tarp material as it is made of woven polyester which is a windproof material while also being coated in polyurethane which is a waterproof material. It is cheap to make as well and can be made by organizations combatting homelessness.
