**Context:**
Client wanted to visualize the design of their backyard before construction started. I made this 3D mock up which the client approved.
  
**My Angle:**
.I started by asking my client what they want out of their backyard space. I was told to make an entertainment space that expands the deck, but also leave enough grass space to play on and a large organized garden with garden beds. My angle on this was to design a fun space to kick back and relax as well as entertain guests at the same time. I then removed and replaced the railing on the top deck, extended the deck to floor level, and added stairs. I also added the shed they currently have and made garden beds so the garden is now protected. The backyard turned out exactly as I designed it and the clients were very pleased.
