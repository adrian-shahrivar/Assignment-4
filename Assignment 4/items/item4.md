**Context:**
This was a class assignment to hack a box. The idea of this project was to think outside the box to design something that shares the properties of a standard cardboard box, while having an altered configuration. 
  
**My Angle:**
My angle on this is was to emphasize and keep the characteristics of a box but alter its configuration to give it a new purpose. The property of a box is that it contains and protects the items inside the box. We then noticed that many bottles or cups can’t fit the standard cupholder, is either too small or too big, and rattles or doesn’t fit. We decided to design an adjustable attachment to the cup holder that caters to the different sizes of different liquid containers. I then made a prototype on AutoCad. We made a wide box that has a base that sits inside the cupholder. Inside the box there is a part that has a spring that puts pressure on all sides of the liquid container. This keeps the container fixed to the middle of the box and stable so it won’t rattle, shake, or fall out. The top of the contact part is also curved so a bottle can slide in easily. I then added rubber pieces on the bases so it fits snug inside the cupholder after collecting feedback. The rubber has a high coefficient of friction which will make sure that the cup holder attachment doesn’t slip out of the cup holder.
